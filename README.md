# This is the README for our Mountain project at BeCode.

Hello everybody and welcome to our evolutive README, here you can follow our journey to become Fullstack JavaScript Web Developers.

This readme will be separate into "sprints" where we gonna write what we have done, what we need to do and the actual status of the project.

As we use the Agile method, we separate our work into "sprints". Sprints represent 4 and a half days of work. For each sprint we will do a to-do list of what we must do during the week. We create the next sprint every Friday afternoon and split work between the team every Monday morning.

## Team members :

## And now let's talk about the project :

We have the ambition to make a "Netflix"-like website without the movies of course (that's illegal) with some extra features like a forum a real-time chat to continue talking about the movies that we like.

### Features :
- Subscribe (with confirmation e-mail)
- Multiple profile creation by account
- Watchlist / Fav
- Watchin' History
- Search by Title, Actors, Genre

### Figma / Wireframe 
We created a Figma to direct the visual aspect of the site and the functionalities

### Technologies we use : 
We decide to use the MERN Stack :
