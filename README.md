# This is the README for our Mountain project at BeCode.

Hello everybody and welcome to our evolutive README, here you can follow our journey to become Fullstack JavaScript Web Developers.

This readme will be separate into "sprints" where we gonna write what we have done, what we need to do and the actual status of the project.

As we use the Agile method, we separate our work into "sprints". Sprints represent 4 and a half days of work. For each sprint we will do a to-do list of what we must do during the week. We create the next sprint every Friday afternoon and split work between the team every Monday morning.
