          <h1>HollyBreak Terms of Use</h1>
          <div>
            HollyBreak provides a personalized subscription service that allows
            our members to access entertainment content ("HollyBreak content")
            over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and
            other devices ("HollyBreak ready devices"). These Terms of Use
            govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use,
            "HollyBreak service", "our service" or "the service" means the
            personalized service provided by HollyBreak for discovering and
            accessing HollyBreak content, including all features and
            functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and user
            interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our
            service.

          <br />
          <h2>1. Membership</h2>
          <br />
          <div>
            1.1. Your HollyBreak membership will continue until terminated. To
            use the HollyBreak service you must have Internet access and a
            HollyBreak ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment
            Methods. "Payment Method" means a current, valid, accepted method of
            payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include
            payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel
            your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge
            the membership fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment Method
            (see "Cancellation" below).
            <br />
            <br />
            1.2. We may offer a number of membership plans, including
            memberships offered by third parties in conjunction with the
            provision of their own products and services. Some membership plans
            may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be
            disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available
            to you. You can find specific details regarding your HollyBreak
            membership by visiting the HollyBreak.com website and clicking on
            the "Account" link available at the top of the pages under your
            profile name.
          </div>
          <br />
          <h2>2. Promotional Offers</h2>
          <br />
          <div>
            We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or
            memberships (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by
            HollyBreak at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke
            an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine
            you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or
            recent HollyBreak membership may not be eligible for certain
            introductory Offers. We may use information such as device ID,
            method of payment or an account email address used with an existing
            or recent HollyBreak membership to determine Offer eligibility. The
            eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will
            be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in other
            communications made available to you.
          </div>
          <br />
          <h2>3. Billing and Cancellation</h2>
          <br />
          <div>
            3.1. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for the HollyBreak service
            will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date
            indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle
            will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you
            signed up for the service. In some cases your payment date may
            change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully
            settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid
            membership began on a day not contained in a given month. Visit the
            HollyBreak.com website and click on the "Billing details" link on
            the "Account" page to see your next payment date. If you signed up
            for HollyBreak using your account with a third party as a Payment
            Method, you can find the billing information about your HollyBreak
            membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
            <br />
            <br />
            3.2. Payment Methods. To use the HollyBreak service you must provide
            one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment
            Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment
            Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your
            subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected
            amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to
            expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel
            your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we
            have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment
            Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign
            transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your
            Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment
            Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for
            details.
            <br />
            <br />
            3.3. Updating your Payment Methods. You can update your Payment
            Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your
            Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service
            providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to
            charge the applicable Payment Method(s).
            <br />
            <br />
            3.4. Cancellation. You can cancel your HollyBreak membership at any
            time, and you will continue to have access to the HollyBreak service
            through the end of your billing period. Payments are non-refundable
            and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership
            periods or unused HollyBreak content. To cancel, go to the "Account"
            page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel
            your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of
            your current billing period. To see when your account will close,
            click "Billing details" on the "Account" page. If you signed up for
            HollyBreak using your account with a third party as a Payment Method
            and wish to cancel your HollyBreak membership, you may need to do so
            through such third party, for example by visiting your account with
            the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or
            unsubscribing from the HollyBreak service through that third party.
            <br />
            <br />
            3.5. Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. We may change our
            subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time;
            however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans
            will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>4. HollyBreak Service</h2>
            <br />
            <div>
              4.1. You must be at least 18 years of age to become a member of
              the HollyBreak service. Minors may only use the service under the
              supervision of an adult.
              <br />
              <br />
              4.2. The HollyBreak service and any content accessed through the
              service are for your personal and non-commercial use only and may
              not be shared with individuals beyond your household. During your
              HollyBreak membership we grant you a limited, non-exclusive,
              non-transferable right to access the HollyBreak service and
              HollyBreak content. Except for the foregoing, no right, title or
              interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the
              service for public performances.
              <br />
              <br />
              4.3. You may access the HollyBreak content primarily within the
              country in which you have established your account and only in
              geographic locations where we offer our service and have licensed
              such content. The content that may be available will vary by
              geographic location and will change from time to time. The number
              of devices on which you may simultaneously watch depends on your
              chosen subscription plan and is specified on the "Account" page.
              <br />
              <br />
              4.4. The HollyBreak service, including the content library, is
              regularly updated. In addition, we continually test various
              aspects of our service, including our websites, user interfaces,
              promotional features and availability of HollyBreak content. You
              can turn off test participation at any time by visiting the
              "Account" page and changing the "Test participation" settings.
              <br />
              <br />
              4.5. Some HollyBreak content is available for temporary download
              and offline viewing on certain supported devices ("Offline
              Titles"). Limitations apply, including restrictions on the number
              of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of devices that
              can contain Offline Titles, the time period within which you will
              need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long the Offline
              Titles will remain accessible. Some Offline Titles may not be
              playable in certain countries and if you go online in a country
              where you would not be able to stream that Offline Title, the
              Offline Title will not be playable while you are in that country.
              <br />
              <br />
              4.6. You agree not to archive, reproduce, distribute, modify,
              display, perform, publish, license, create derivative works from,
              offer for sale, or use (except as explicitly authorized in these
              Terms of Use) content and information contained on or obtained
              from or through the HollyBreak service. You also agree not to:
              circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of
              the content protections in the HollyBreak service; use any robot,
              spider, scraper or other automated means to access the HollyBreak
              service; decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any software
              or other products or processes accessible through the HollyBreak
              service; insert any code or product or manipulate the content of
              the HollyBreak service in any way; or use any data mining, data
              gathering or extraction method. In addition, you agree not to
              upload, post, e-mail or otherwise send or transmit any material
              designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any
              computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment
              associated with the HollyBreak service, including any software
              viruses or any other computer code, files or programs. We may
              terminate or restrict your use of our service if you violate these
              Terms of Use or are engaged in illegal or fraudulent use of the
              service.
              <br />
              <br />
              4.7. The quality of the display of the HollyBreak content may vary
              from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of
              factors, such as your location, the bandwidth available through
              and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD, Ultra HD and HDR
              availability is subject to your Internet service and device
              capabilities. Not all content is available in all formats, such as
              HD, Ultra HD and HDR, and not all subscription plans allow you to
              receive content in all formats. Default playback settings on
              cellular networks exclude HD, Ultra HD and HDR content. The
              minimum connection speed for SD quality is 1.0 Mbps; however, we
              recommend a faster connection for improved video quality. A
              download speed of at least 3.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to
              receive HD content (defined as a resolution of 720p or higher). A
              download speed of at least 15.0 Mbps per stream is recommended to
              receive Ultra HD (defined as a resolution of 4K or higher). You
              are responsible for all Internet access charges. Please check with
              your Internet provider for information on possible Internet data
              usage charges. The time it takes to begin watching HollyBreak
              content will vary based on a number of factors, including your
              location, available bandwidth at the time, the content you have
              selected and the configuration of your HollyBreak ready device.
              <br />
              <br />
              4.8. HollyBreak software is developed by, or for, HollyBreak and
              may solely be used for authorized streaming and to access
              HollyBreak content through HollyBreak ready devices. This software
              may vary by device and medium, and functionalities and features
              may also differ between devices. You acknowledge that the use of
              the service may require third party software that is subject to
              third party licenses. You agree that you may automatically receive
              updated versions of the HollyBreak software and related
              third-party software.

            <h2>5. Passwords and Account Access</h2>
            <br />
            <div>
              The member who created the HollyBreak account and whose Payment
              Method is charged (the "Account Owner") is responsible for any
              activity that occurs through the HollyBreak account. To maintain
              control over the account and to prevent anyone from accessing the
              account (which would include information on viewing history for
              the account), the Account Owner should maintain control over the
              HollyBreak ready devices that are used to access the service and
              not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method
              associated with the account to anyone. You are responsible for
              updating and maintaining the accuracy of the information you
              provide to us relating to your account. We can terminate your
              account or place your account on hold in order to protect you,
              HollyBreak or our partners from identity theft or other fraudulent
              activity.

            <br />
            <div>
              6.1. Governing Law. These Terms of Use shall be governed by and
              construed in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands. These
              terms will not limit any consumer protection rights that you may
              be entitled to under the mandatory laws of your country of

              please visit the HollyBreak Help Center, which is accessible

              Service may best be able to assist you by using a remote access
              support tool through which we have full access to your computer.
              If you do not want us to have this access, you should not consent
              to support through the remote access tool, and we will assist you
              through other means.
              <br />
              <br />
              6.4. Survival. If any provision or provisions of these Terms of
              Use shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the
              validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
              shall remain in full force and effect.
              <br />
              <br />
              6.5. Changes to Terms of Use. HollyBreak may, from time to time,
